This is a dynamic space shooter game that utilises HTML, CSS and JS , where enemies are appearing from different sides of the play area.

There are two modes of gameplay - standard and random. Standard gameplay features a fixed set of enemy sequences, while random gameplay features randomised (i.e. more dynamic) enemy sequences.

You can use the arrow buttons (i.e. up, down, left and right) or WASD buttons (great for people who are used to playing first person shooter game!).
